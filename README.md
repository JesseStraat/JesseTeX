# beamertheme and records
The beamertheme and records packages were originally written by the TeXniCie at A-Eskwadraat. Partial credit for these packages go to them (especially Aldo).
For example, the TeXniCie created the progress bar in the beamer theme.
In the future, I will work on remaking these packages to be more original, without reusing any code written by the TeXniCie.
